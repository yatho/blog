# How I became a Speaker

It has been an incredible journey for me to become a Speaker this year. Let me share my story with you.

## Setting the Goal

In 2022 (2 years ago), I launched myself a new challenge by chatting with some Speakers at Devoxx France Conference. Become a speaker.

This idea was not coming from me. It was a speaker who said :
- "why not try it ?"

At this moment I said something like :
- "I can't I have not enough experience, who am I to talk front of many persons ?"

I was affected by imposter syndrome.

## Fight against Imposter Syndrome

One of the biggest challenges I faced on my journey to becoming a Speaker was dealing with Impostor Syndrome. It's a common feeling among many aspiring speakers, where you doubt your own abilities and feel like a fraud, despite evidence of your accomplishments.

To overcome this, I had to remind myself that I had valuable knowledge and experiences to share. I focused on building my confidence by practicing my talks.

I found a trusted mentor (Christophe Jollivet) to support me and help me to know how enter in this new world.

## Preparing for the Journey

I knew I had to put in a lot of effort and preparation. I started by researching the topics. At the begining I would like to talk about JavaScript subject to permit to use my knowledge to create the talk and fight the stage fright before begin. We decided with my mentor to work on 2 subjects to increase the chance to be selected for a talk.

## Crafting the Talk

Once we had chosen topic, I spent countless hours crafting the talk. I wanted to make sure that every slide, every demo, and every word I spoke would leave a lasting impression on the audience. I sought feedback from my peers and made several iterations to refine my presentation.

## Submitting the Proposal

With the talk ready, we submitted the proposal to the most of organizing committee available. I was thrilled when I received the confirmation that my talk had been accepted. It was a validation of all the hard work I had put into preparing for this moment.

## Preparing for the Stage

As the conference date approached, I dedicated myself to rehearsing my talk. I practiced a lot. I wanted to ensure that I would deliver a flawless presentation on the big day.

I was reassure to not be alone on first try. I think it is a big luck to have someone to help and convince you in doubt moment.

## The Big Day

Finally, the day of my talk arrived. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as I stepped onto the stage. I was sick. I have lost my voice the day before. The stress was maximum. But as soon as I started speaking, all my nerves disappeared. It was an incredible experience to share my knowledge and insights with such an enthusiastic audience.

At the end, you are like drug guy who take a fix. The cloud is your neighboor. It was an incredible feeling.

## Now

I continue this journey by myself. I am trying other type talk as "Hands on" this year.

The Graal arrived when I received the acceptance from Devoxx France this year.

I will continue in the futur !
