# How I Became a Devoxx Speaker

It has been an incredible journey for me to become a Devoxx speaker this year. Let me share my story with you.

## Setting the Goal

About a year ago, I decided to challenge myself and pursue a new goal - becoming a technical speaker at Devoxx, one of the most prestigious conferences in the industry. I was inspired by the amazing speakers I had seen at previous Devoxx events and wanted to be a part of that community.

## Preparing for the Journey

To achieve my goal, I knew I had to put in a lot of effort and preparation. I started by researching the topics that I was passionate about and that would resonate with the Devoxx audience. I wanted to deliver a talk that would be both informative and engaging.

## Crafting the Talk

Once I had chosen my topic, I spent countless hours crafting my talk. I wanted to make sure that every slide, every demo, and every word I spoke would leave a lasting impression on the audience. I sought feedback from my peers and made several iterations to refine my presentation.

## Submitting the Proposal

With my talk ready, I submitted my proposal to the Devoxx organizing committee. I was thrilled when I received the confirmation that my talk had been accepted. It was a validation of all the hard work I had put into preparing for this moment.

## Preparing for the Stage

As the conference date approached, I dedicated myself to rehearsing my talk. I practiced in front of a mirror, recorded myself, and sought feedback from trusted friends and colleagues. I wanted to ensure that I would deliver a flawless presentation on the big day.

## The Big Day

Finally, the day of my talk arrived. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as I stepped onto the stage. But as soon as I started speaking, all my nerves disappeared. The audience was engaged, and I could feel the energy in the room. It was an incredible experience to share my knowledge and insights with such an enthusiastic audience.

## Reflections

Becoming a Devoxx speaker has been a transformative experience for me. It has not only boosted my confidence as a speaker but also opened doors to new opportunities and connections within the industry. I am grateful for the support I received along the way and look forward to continuing my journey as a technical speaker.
